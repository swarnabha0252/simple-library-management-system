# Simple Library Management System

This is a small, personal project built in Python. The goal was to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by creating a basic command-line application to manage books and library members.

### Key Features
- **Add & Manage:** You can add books and members to a library.
- **Borrow & Return:** It handles the process of checking out and returning books.
- **Information:** You can see a list of all books (and which ones are unavailable) and all registered members.

### How to Use
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the `library_management.py` file from your terminal:
   ```bash
   python library_management.py

### What I Learned
- Creating and using classes (Book, Member, Library).
- Using dictionaries for efficient data storage.
- Using methods like `.upper()`, `.split()`, and f-strings to process and format user input and output (string manipulation).
- The basics of building a simple command-line interface with a menu.
